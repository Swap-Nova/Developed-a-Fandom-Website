   <h2> <em> Personality-</em></h2>
   <p>
       <ul>
           <li> Even though Izuku was born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might due to his innate heroism <br>
            and a strong sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil.</li>
           <li> All Might passed on his transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth holder of One For All.</li>
           <li> Izuku is caring and emotional, never hesitating to help or rescue someone in danger, even if he knows that he might not be strong <br>
             or qualified enough to do it. </li>
           <li> Izuku is known to help or lecture people with personal and emotional problems, regardless if it's his business or not, <br>
            claiming that a hero should meddle in other people's lives.</li>
           <li> He has a strong fascination with heroes and is shown well-versed in their history, sometimes surprising the heroes <br>
            with his vast knowledge. Of all heroes, the Symbol of Peace</li>
       </ul>

        <h2> <em> Quirk-</em></h2>
        <p>
            <h3> <b>âœ¨ <u>One For All</u></b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li> One For All is the transferable Quirk that is possessed by its ninth and current host, Izuku Midoriya.</li>
                <li> In the past, it was originally used by Yoichi Shigaraki, and later, its other previous hosts: Hikage Shinomori, Daigoro Banjo, En, Nana Shimura, Toshinori Yagi, <br> 
                    and the other two users before them.</li>
                <li> The origin of One For All is itself a powerful will that refused to submit to All For One.</li>
                <li> For this reason, One For All cannot be stolen by any means. In order for the Quirk to be transferred, the current owner must freely choose to transfer it. </li>
                <li> One For All also allows the user to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing them to significantly enhance all of their physical abilities to a superhuman level.</li>
                <li> The core of One For All has grown in strength from being passed from user to user, and the Quirk Factors of all of the previous users have merged into the core.</li>
                <li> <em> <b>Izuku is the first user capable of accessing the Quirks of the previous users. </em></li></b>
